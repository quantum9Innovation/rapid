## What is rapid?
Rapid, quite simply, is a collection of style guides, tools, recommendations, and standards for Open Source Software (OSS). Rapid is designed to make contributing to open source as easy as possible by creating easily adoptable standards that make sense.

## What does rapid support now?
Rapid is currently a work-in-progress and contributions are always welcome as we continue to grow our standards database to more programming languages and disciplines. Currently, rapid contains:

| Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Rapid Versioning System | The sane alternative to semantic versioning |

## How will rapid grow?
Rapid is dependent on contributors to continually increase the number of guides and standards we have for open source. If you have an idea, submit a PR to have it merged and incorporated in the next release of rapid.

## How can I show that my project follows rapid guidelines?
If you use all of rapid's guidelines you can add this universal badge to your project's README with:
```markdown
![code standard: rapid](https://shields.mitmproxy.org/badge/code%20standard-rapid-blue)
```
![code standard: rapid](https://shields.mitmproxy.org/badge/code%20standard-rapid-blue)

If instead your project only follows a certain rapid guideline or directive (like uses Rapid versioning), or you want to explicitly list all rapid guidelines that your project follows, use the following badges:

### Rapid Versioning System
```markdown
![versioning: rapid](https://shields.mitmproxy.org/badge/versioning-rapid-blue)
```

## That's it!
Thank you to all contributors that helped create rapid and continue to make it easier for people to contribute to OSS:
