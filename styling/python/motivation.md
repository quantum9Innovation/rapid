# Why Rapid Styling?

## Why Style at all?
Because Python code is a mess—there are little if *any* naming standards, whitespace is used carelessly, library code is a pain to read, and nobody understands *anything*. Take this code from `matplotlib`:

```python
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception as err:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array") from err
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")
    # begin generation of lookup table
    if N == 1:
        # convention: use the y = f(x=1) value for a 1-element lookup table
        lut = np.array(y0[-1])
    else:
        x = x * (N - 1)
        xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

        distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
        lut = np.concatenate([
            [y1[0]],
            distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
            [y0[-1]],
        ])
    # ensure that the lut is confined to values between 0 and 1 by clipping it
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

Without any docstring or description, it would be impossible to tell that this is from matplotlib's `colors.py` `_create_lookup_table` function. The equations are hard to read, the code is grouped together in chunks that don't have much to do with each other, and the limited usage of whitespace makes the structure unclear.

In order to solve this problem of constantly changing Python styles, inconsistent styling across projects, and unreadable code we propose the Rapid Python Style Guide, which creates a flexible but completely readable standard for styling code in Python.
